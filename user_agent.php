<p>Milestone Dispute Resolution Process</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li class="wt-topic wt-black">STAGE 1 - Identifying the issue</li>
<div class="wt-description pl-4">
<p>The complainant should select the Project and the Milestone payment or payments to be disputed. A User could contest all the Milestones related to a single project in one dispute.</p>
<p>After which, a description of the issue and an explanation of why the dispute is being opened should be given. From this stage until Stage 3, users are encouraged to attach any files that could support their claims.</p>
<p>Finally, the complainant is requested to enter the amount he or she is prepared to pay for the Project (if an Emplloyer) or wish to get paid for the Project (if a Freelancer). The amount could be between 0 and the total amount of the Milestone Payment(s) in question.</p>
</div>
<li class="wt-topic wt-black">STAGE 2 - Negotiations</li>
<div class="wt-description pl-4">
<p>At this stage, either party can negotiate for partial compensation, or (after a period of time) choose to have Freelancer's Dispute Team arbitrate the dispute. Both parties will have the opportunity to tell their side of the story and also negotiate terms to resolve the issue between themselves.</p>
<p>Only the party who originally filed for the dispute can cancel the dispute. If the issue cannot be resolved through negotiation, either party can choose to pay the Arbitration Fee to have the dispute arbitrated by the Dispute Team. The Arbitration Fee will be refunded if the dispute is either settled through mutual agreement or cancelled before reaching arbitration.</p>
</div>
<li class="wt-topic wt-black">STAGE 3 - Final Offers and Evidence</li>
<div class="wt-description pl-4">
<p>After one of the involved parties has paid the Arbitration Fee, the other party has 4 days to also pay the fee. Either party still has the option in this period to negotiate with the other party.</p>
<p>If the responding party does not pay the arbitration fee within the 4 days, the result will be in favour of the party who escalated the dispute into arbitration first.</p>
<p>If a solution is found before the responding party pays the fee, the party who paid the Arbitration Fee will be refunded this fee.</p>
<p>Stage 3 is the last stage where both Users can submit their final evidence to support their case. After Stage 3, the involved parties are no longer allowed to submit evidence. The dispute will be resolved based upon the evidence provided through the Dispute System, or that is otherwise available to the Dispute Team, such as the project description and correspondence between the parties.</p>
<p>Once the dispute has proceeded to Stage 4, further evidence will no longer be accepted.</p>
</div>
<li class="wt-topic wt-black">STAGE 4 - Arbitration</li>
<div class="wt-description pl-4">
<p>At Stage 4, the Dispute Team will review all evidence and other information provided to reach a decision (usually within 48 hours). Dispute verdicts are final, binding, and irreversible. The party who wins the dispute will be refunded their Arbitration Fee.</p>
<p>In the event that one of the parties of the Dispute has paid the Arbitration Fee, the other party will be given 4 days to pay the Arbitration Fee to move into Arbitration, and failure to do such will close the dispute by default, in favor of the party who initiated stage 4, with the arbitration fee initially paid refunded.</p>
